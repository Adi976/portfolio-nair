1. Find factorial using functions

def fact(num):
    ft=1
    while(num>0):
        ft*=num
        num=num-1
    return ft

num=int(input("Enter a number:"))
f=fact(num)
print('Factorial is',f)
    
2. Largest element in an array

import random

arr = []
for i in range(0, 11):
    arr.append(random.randint(0, 100))  

max=arr[0]
for i in range (0,11):
    if(arr[i]>max):
        max=arr[i]
print('Largest:',max)
print(arr)

3.Find mean of given numbers

import random

arr = []
for i in range(0, 11):
    arr.append(random.randint(0, 6))  

mean=0

for i in range(0,11):
    mean+=arr[i]
    
print('Mean:',mean/10)
print(arr)

4. Draw a line in the diagram from position (0,0)to(6,250)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x=[0,6]
y=[0,250]

plt.plot(x,y,marker='o',markerfacecolor='red')
plt.show()

5. Draw a bar plot histogram pie chart and a scatter plot by creating data using dictionaries

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

bar_data={
    'Adi':500,
    'Bob':400,
    'Mary':700,
    'Jason':200
}

plt.bar(bar_data.keys(),bar_data.values())
plt.show()

6. Analyse relationship between persons age and income in a data scatter

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

age=[56,45,78,23,48,19]
income=[10,20,30,40,50,60]

plt.scatter(age,income)
plt.title("Age-Income Analysis")
plt.show()

7. A teacher wants to understand exam scores create a histogram to visualise the distribution adjust the number of bins to make the plot interactive

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

exam_scores = [55, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 100, 90]

plt.hist(exam_scores, bins=5) 
plt.xlabel('Exam Scores')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Distribution of Exam Scores')
plt.show()


8. A financial consultant wants to visualise a client's monthly expenses create a piechart of expense breakdown include percentage labels and a title for the chart

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

expenses=[55,50,62,49,59]
labels=["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May"]

plt.pie(expenses,labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%')
plt.show()

9. You have recorded temp data over a week visualise temp trends in a week using line plot customise the line style colour and markers 

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

temp_data=[35,36,34,38,37,36,35]
days=["Mon","Tue","Wed","Thur","Fri","Sat","Sun"]
plt.plot(days,temp_data,color="yellow",marker='o',markerfacecolor="red")
plt.show()


10. Analyse the relationship between study hours and exam scores for a group of students create a scatter plot to visualise the data include labels for x axis 

11. A family wants to visualise the allocation of their monthly budget among different categories. create a stacked bar chart to represent the budget allocation. Customise colors

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

y1=[2,4,5,6,7]
y2=[3,1,2,4,5]

x=['A','B','C','D','E']

plt.bar(x,y1,label="Group 1")
plt.bar(x,y2,bottom=y1,label="Group 2")
plt.show()

12. A web analyst wants to visualise the distribution of a websites traffic sources create a pychart and adjust the start angle

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

traffic = [45, 57, 20, 34, 52, 43, 55]
days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thur", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]

plt.pie(traffic, labels=days, autopct='%1.1f%%')
plt.show()


13. Analyse the visualisations draw conclusions and insights about the student performance
1. who scored highest abd lowest
2. Is there a corelation between study hours and test scores
3. What is the typical distribution of study hours
4. How do attendance percentage differ among the students
5. How have the test scores changed among the students
